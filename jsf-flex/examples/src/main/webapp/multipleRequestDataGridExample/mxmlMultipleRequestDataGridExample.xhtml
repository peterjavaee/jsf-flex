            Currently if the data is large, it is broken into pieces of 50 with there being two batches, making
            the size of the cache 100 rows. When a limit is reached s.t. more information is required, one set will remain cached 
            with an another of batch of at most 50 being returned from the server. In the future it is thought to possibly provide 
            capability in setting these fields.
