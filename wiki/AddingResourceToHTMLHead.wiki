= Introduction =

This page will provide a brief overview of how to insert resources such as JS files within the head of the HTML page.

= Details =

There currently exists a java file to insert JS content to the head of HTML page :
 * {{{JsfFlexResource}}}

_It is assumed that the resource file is within the correct resource directory within the *src* hierarchy._

So in order to add the resource to the head of the HTML file, one simply gets the instance of {{{JsfFlexResource}}} {since they are abstract classes} and invoke the addResource method providing the class where the resource is nested under and the resource name.

Following is an example from {{{AbstractMXMLUIApplication}}} :
{{{
  JsfFlexResource jsfFlexResource = JsfFlexResource.getInstance();
  jsfFlexResource.addResource(getClass(), JSF_FLEX_COMMUNICATOR_CORE_JS);
  jsfFlexResource.addResource(getClass(), JSF_FLEX_COMMUNICATOR_LOGGER_JS);
}}}
